## 02. ABOUT THE CREATOR

Here are some informations about me.

Nickname      : KGenjuro
From          : Hildesheim, Germany
Year of Birth : '73

I'm working for a rather large printing & prepress company as a
media-designer. Besides that, I love to programm games with MUGEN
& Flash and sometimes I record hiphop tracks (www.inkema.de). My
No.1 Hobby is SNK's NeoGeo and I spent a lot of time playing games
like Samurai Shodown IV and Realbout Fatal Fury 2 until I fall asleep.
Together with a close friend, I run the biggest german NeoGeo review
page, www.daddelkingz.de 

## 03. HISTORYCAL REFERENCE

TAKEZO's "Historycal Reference" is more of a "Videogame Reference".
Even a blind man can see his reference to Genjuro from Samurai Shodown
and (as you can guess by my nickname) that's my favorite character
from the series. Actually, I planned to make a superdeformed Genjuro
instead of a completly original character. I created TAKEZO using
a Genjuro-Keyring as a base. Later, I decided to make him a
uniqe fighter and I gave him a uniqe set of special moves. Okay, there
are still 'cards' just like in Genjuro, but they are not Hanafuda and
they are handled totally different.

TAKEZO's supporter, Miyamoto Musashi actually really existed around
1600 and is well known as the developer of the two-handed sword-tech
and the former of the niten-ichiryu (two blades/one school) sword
style. He died 'delighted' at the age of ~60 after living the last
years of his life in a cave and after writing the "book of the five
rings". The Samurai Shodown character Haohmaru is based on him. The
Sprite of Musashi in my Takezo is taken from an ancient painting that
shows Musashi training with two swords.
