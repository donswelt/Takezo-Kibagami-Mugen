## 02. STORY

- Prolog -

Not much is known about Takezo's childhood. He was raised by the keeper
of a gambling house after his parents abandoned him when he was still
a baby. The gambler found him in a redlight district of Edo. He tought
him the arts of sword-fighting. Takezo then developed his own unique
technique when he was 12 years old. At the age of 18, he found a trace
to his real father and he wanted to kill him in revenge for his struggle
as a baby. But before he was able to found him, he heard rumors about
is father being killed by a demon raised from hell. Takezo got scared...
not because the dead of his real father but about the possible death
of his mother. He asked the gambler about her whereabout but he could
only guess. Takezo went on a journey to find his mother and to protect
her from the evil demon... and of course while he is at it, to kill
the demon.

Takezo isn't the guy you like to introduce to ya mom, nor the cool
fella with whom you like to party all night, drinking, smoking weed
and stuff. That's why he don't have many friends around him. Mainly
because he killed most of the people he met on his journey after he
found proof for them being demons (like NOT farting after lunch, or
SITTING in the bushes while peeing). Because of that fact, his 'pals'
happens to be a little bit... strange ;)

- Strange Pals #1: The Monk -

While traveling through the land of Hizen, Takezo found an amulet
carved with 108 demon names (it was rather large). He looked at it and
came to the conclusion that it was very ugly, so he threw it away. It
broke while hitting the ground. Inside the amulet, the spirit
of a long dead monk was held captive. After he recognized that he was
free again, he sworn loyality to his brave rescuer until the end of
time (or until he knows how to posses a human body). From then on
Takezo summoned the monk whenever he is in VERY deep trouble (notice
the 'VERY', Takezo is ALWAYS in 'deep' trouble and it's not good to
have a dead one-eyed guy hanging around yourself, 24/7).

- Strange Pals #2: The Frog -

On his journey to seek the demon, Takezo traveled on the road that
leads from Osaka to Kyoto. On this road he reached a mountain, from
which he heard that one can see both towns Osaka and Kyoto. He decided
to climb up to the peak of the mountain to enjoy the view. Just a
minute before he reached the mountain's top, Takezo accidently stepped
on something rather softly and he heard something that sounds like
'squit...'. He looked down a saw a flat frog lying on the ground.
The frog had a last thought: "...just... when I finished...
the half way to... Kyo...to...". He then died. Takezo continued his
walk to the top where he met another frog. They both look each other
in the face and they kept quite for a few minutes. After a few more
minutes they fell into the following conversation:

Frog:
"can you show me the way to Osaka?"

Takezo:
"I don't understand you, are you searching a demon, too?"

Frog:
"I don't understand you, but I guess you will led me to Osaka, not?"

Takezo:
"Heh, we can search together! I will help you finding your demon and
you will help me finding mine!"

Frog:
"Now then... let's go to Osaka! I just hope we don't encounter any
demons. I am soooooooo scared of demons!"

...

note: this is in no way inspired by any japanese folktale ;)


- Strange Pals #3: Miyamoto Musashi -

On his journey, Takezo was forced to sleep in the wilderness often.
One night, he found a cave equiped with a fire-pit and a sleeping
place. Takezo went to sleep. He woke up suddenly in the middle of
the night because he heard a strange sound, outside the cave. While
he rised his head, he forgot that he was in a cave and his head
collided with the massive rock-hard ceiling. The heavy shake pushed
his spirit out of his head into a spiritual world where he found
himself lying on a beach. He then saw a beautiful ghost with a long
sword chasing swallows along the beach. After he examined the scene
carefully he noticed that the beautiful spirit was a young man (yuk!)
and he also saw another ghost. An old man followed the young one with
two swords in his hand, screaming: "I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!! DAMN
YOU! LEAVE ME ALONE WITH YOUR STUPID SWALLOW SLICES DAY BY DAY, HOUR
BY HOUR.... DAMN YOU!!!". At that moment, Takezo's body regained it's
original condition and a spiritual gate appears behind him to drag the
lost soul back to it's body. The old man saw the odd thing that
happened only a few yards away from him and started to scream: "HEY!
WAIT! PLEASE, TAKE ME WITH YOU! I CAN'T STAY HERE ANY LONGER TOGETHER
WITH THIS SWALLOW SLICING MANIAC!". Before Takezo recognized whats
going on, he found himself in the arms of the old man passing the
spiritual gate. Back in the cave, he woke up with a massive headache...
and another undead spirit next to him who granted him his support to
the end of time, whenever he is in VERY, VERY deep trouble.

## 03. BEHIND THE SCENE

Creating TAKEZO was a hard piece of work. As you might hve recognized, I
can't draw really good. I mean, I am able to draw a few characters
on a sheet of paper using a pen but when it comes to pixel-drawing...
I'm screwed. That's the reason why I had to come up with something
funny. All the cute little superdeformed drawings of skilled artist
like Masamune Shiro and Jukito Kishiro came to my mind. They are
indeed very simple, but the are very funny because of their overacting
when it comes to show emotions. That's what I wanted to do: creating
a rather ugly sprite and putting in funny animations and stuff.

I liked (and still like) to do a serious character, but the simple fact
is: I can't... but what the hell :) TAKEZO turned out to be a very
funny looking guy and that's cool, too.

I created every single frame in photshop 5.0 using the advantage of
the layer-feature to animate Takezo's bodyparts. Don't ask me why I
didn't put at least a little shading into him. I dunno myself. On my
Harddisk I have some frames of Takezo with shading applyed. I'm
thinking about releasing a new .sff-file for him, sometimes in the
future.

I did the recordings for TAKEZO's voice myself, using Wavelab.
Of course, I pitched the recordings to a lot higher level to make my
rather deep and rough voice fit TAKEZO's overall funny look. I love
giving my voice to video-game characters. For those of you who don't
know, I also did the voices for my MUGEN-Adaption of SNK's BigMan for
the older versions of MUGEN and right now, I am recording voices for
Dr.M's Brutal - Paws of Fury - Remix, where I will give my voice to
Kendo Coyote and Karate Croc.

## 04. ABOUT THE CREATOR

Here are some informations about me.

Nickname      : KGenjuro
From          : Hildesheim, Germany
Year of Birth : '73

I'm working for a rather large printing & prepress company as a
media-designer. Besides that, I love to programm games with MUGEN
& Flash and sometimes I record hiphop tracks (www.inkema.de). My
No.1 Hobby is SNK's NeoGeo and I spent a lot of time playing games
like Samurai Shodown IV and Realbout Fatal Fury 2 until I fall asleep.
Together with a close friend, I run the biggest german NeoGeo review
page, www.daddelkingz.de 

## 05. HISTORYCAL REFERENCE

TAKEZO's "Historycal Reference" is more of a "Videogame Reference".
Even a blind man can see his reference to Genjuro from Samurai Shodown
and (as you can guess by my nickname) that's my favorite character
from the series. Actually, I planned to make a superdeformed Genjuro
instead of a completly original character. I created TAKEZO using
a Genjuro-Keyring as a base. Later, I decided to make him a
uniqe fighter and I gave him a uniqe set of special moves. Okay, there
are still 'cards' just like in Genjuro, but they are not Hanafuda and
they are handled totally different.

TAKEZO's supporter, Miyamoto Musashi actually really existed around
1600 and is well known as the developer of the two-handed sword-tech
and the former of the niten-ichiryu (two blades/one school) sword
style. He died 'delighted' at the age of ~60 after living the last
years of his life in a cave and after writing the "book of the five
rings". The Samurai Shodown character Haohmaru is based on him. The
Sprite of Musashi in my Takezo is taken from an ancient painting that
shows Musashi training with two swords.
